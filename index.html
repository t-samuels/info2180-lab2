            <h2> Little Women (2019) </h2>

            <p>One of my favourite movies of all time is “Little Women” (2019). There are many different adaptations of the book by Louisa May Alcott, but my favourite is the one directed and adapted by Greta Gerwig. The story is focused on a group of 4 sisters, Meg March, Jo March, Amy March and Beth March. The main themes explored in the movie include childhood innocence, family relationships, unrequited love, and many others. </p>
            <p>I love this movie because of the focus on the “magic” of childhood and then the inevitable loss of that and the forced push into reality and the adult world that every human has to face. 
             We see all the March sisters grapple with this in different ways. It is important to note that in the time period the story is set in, women are not able to have jobs and make their own livelihood. They have to be completely dependent on their husbands to take care of them and their children. It is interesting to see how all the March sisters navigate this reality and the different paths that they choose. 
             Even with the pressure to marry a man who is “well-off” in order to be well-taken care of, the eldest sister, Meg, chooses love over money and decides to marry a poor man who she fell in love with. The second eldest, Jo, is the one who is determined to carve her own path. She is not concerned with getting married or falling in love. She has dreams and aspirations of becoming an authour. Throughout the movie we see her attempts at pursuing that dream and the push back that she faces as a woman in a time where it wasn't normal for women to be more than wives and mothers. The next sister is Amy, who as a child is extremely playful and can sometimes be a troublemaker, but as she matures she realizes the realities of the world she lives in and knows that she must marry rich in order to preserve a future for not only herself, but also her family. She gets criticism for this as being vain or materialistic, but to me it just seems that she accepts that it is something she has to do, especially because none of her other sisters did which means there is no secure financial future for their family. She is willing to give up love for financial security because it is rare to have both in a time where you cannot even make your own money as a woman. The youngest of the March sisters is Beth, a talented girl who unfortunately does not get the chance to grow into a woman and choose her own path like her sisters because she passes away from an illness at a young age. I love this movie so much because of its focus on women’s stories and the transition from girlhood to womanhood, especially in a time where there were so many restrictions put on women. It’s also about the beauty of sisterhood and family, which I also appreciate very deeply. </p>

                <h2> Little Miss Sunshine (2006) </h2>
                <p class = "meta"> September 26, 2025 by Tiana Samuels</p>
                <img src="./images/movies-1.jpg" class = "post-img right">
                <p> A movie I watched recently that really touched me was “Little Miss Sunshine”(2006). If I’m honest, I wasn’t expecting much when I started watching it even though I had heard good things about it. However, as I continued to watch, I started to love it more and more. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I love movies that make me feel things and that I think about long after I’ve watched them, and this was one of those movies. </p>  
                <p> The movie follows a dysfunctional family on a roadtrip so that Olive, the youngest member of the family, can compete in a beauty pageant. The family consists of a mother, father, son, daughter, grandfather and uncle. To me, the movie really shows how much love can really bring people together, even in dysfunctional families where everyone may not like each other all the time. All of the characters are very flawed and controversial which I honestly think makes them more realistic. However, through their flaws and complicated relationships with each other, we still see that they all care for each other at the end of the day. Olive, the little girl, is the heart of the movie and the family, which I think is very sweet. The movie explores themes of depression, family dynamics and childhood innocence, which are all topics that mean a lot to me. My favourite quote from the movie is “A real loser is somebody that’s so afraid of not winning, they don’t even try”, which was said by Olive’s grandfather to her when she was nervous about losing in the beauty pageant. My favourite scene is the scene at the end where Olive’s whole family gets up and dances with her on the stage at the pageant because I think it really shows how much they really care for each other and how they show up for each other when needed.  </p>
